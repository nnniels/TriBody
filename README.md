## Welcome to this git !
This code is all about solving the **three-body problem**, in some cases known to be **planar** and **periodical**. There are two ways of using this git :
 - Simply download already generated videos in the *Animations* folder,
 - Or, get the code and generate your own animations :)

Disclaimer : this code is obviously amateur's work. No garantee, no support, just funny planar periodical trajectories.

## Install & dependencies
This code uses Python 3.12, and was tested on Linux (Kubunu 24.04). It should work fine on any system with Python 3.10+ though.
It requires :
 - numpy
 - matplotlib
 - scipy

I have no idea how licensing for images and videos work, so just do as you please with them.

Many thanks to them !

I hope one day someone will be able to use the trajectories generated here to recreate animations as nice as those.
